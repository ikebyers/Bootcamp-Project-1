## Description

This is a savings calculator designed to take a given income, and a given set of expenses, and determine a working budget. Then, it can display a working budget along with savings goals that can allow the user to plan a budget that will lead to the fullfillment of the user's financial goals.


## Usage

Enter your monthly income in the first text box. Then enter your expenses below in the corresponding categories. You can click on add expenses to add a new expense of your choice to be deducted from your income. Next, enter a financial goal that you want to plan for, with a final total amount and a time frame in months. When the form is complete, click the "Submit All" button to navigate to the next page. On the second page you can view your expenses and income, along with a working budget and a table of savings goals. You may add additional goals or expenses, and you may amend your monthly income. The changes you make will modify the displayed working budget and total expenses.
